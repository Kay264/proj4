# Dijkstra Path Router Doccumentation


## Struct Implementation
SImplementation is a private struct that hides the implementation of the classes member functions.

  - VertexCount() returns the number of vertices in the graph
  - AddVertex() adds a vertex to the graph and associates it with a givben tag
  - GetVertexTag() retries the tag associated witha vertex
  - AddEdge() adds an edge between two verticeseds witha given weight. The bidir parameter is for indicating if a edge is bidirectional
  - Precompute() preforms necessary prrprocessing steps before finding the shortest path
  - FindShortestPath() finds the shortest path between two vertices, returns length
